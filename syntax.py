#variable syntax for python(# represents a comment)
#variable names should not start with special characters, e.g(#number,@,$,*)
#variable names should not start with a numerical number eg(1number, 2number)
#however, number1, number2 is a valid syntax
#a variable name should not have spaces eg(my age, my name)
#composite variable names should be separated by an underscore eg(my_age,my_name)
#or you can use camel-case notation, arrangement, method or way eg(myAge,myName)
#names should not start with capital letters unless they are functions or classes eg(Myname)
#we should use relatable names e.g (when dealing with a customer, call them mycustomer, when dealing with numbers use num1, num2)
#use shorter names e.g (cust for customer, age instead of myage, sal for salary, linc for lincoln)
#variable names should not be repeated in different forms because python is case sensitive e.g(Name and name are not the same)
age=24
name="lincoln"
schooL="refactory"
print(schooL, name)
#declaring variables is a process of naming computer memory spaces
#initializing a variable is a process of giving a variable a value e.g (age is a variable, 24 is its value)
cntry="Uganda"
#the '=' is called the assignment operator in programming language
