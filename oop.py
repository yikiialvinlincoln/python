#OOP-Object oriented programming
#it is a paradigm that advocates for developing software based on real-world objects
#classes vs objects

#principles of oop
#polymorphism
#inheritance
#abstraction
#encapsulation

#a class is a blueprint(original copy of something) of an object e.g a class car has objects such as benz, vw, audi, subaru, toyota etc
#a class gives existence of objects
#a class phone has objects such as  samsung, apple, itel etc.
#objects take on all features of a class but each object is different attributes/characteristics

#an object is an instance(duplicate of something) of a class
#attributes/characteristics of an animal are name, color, number of legs etc 
#a complete set of the above attributes/characteristics constitutes to an object

#how to identify a class of an object, use a phase 'is a'
#e.g a cat 'is a' animal therefore animal is a class while cat is an object of class animal
#lake victoria 'is a' lake 

#abstraction
#refers to ability to ignore other details and you concentrate on the highest level of representation
#abstraction helps in identifying classes
#class names are always singular e.g class car not cars then the objects of class car are cars 

#inheritance; here we have the concept of parent and child
#toyota is a child of a car then class car is a child of toyota making toyota a sub-class
#samsung is a child of a smartphone
#inheritance is the abilty for an object to take on different attributes of a class e.g a toyota wish belongs to a class toyota and toyota belongs to class car

#polymorphism is the ability to take on different attributes of a class

#encapsulation is the ability to have what to share and what not to share

#assignment
#write 2 dynamic functions that prompt a user to;
#input name, age, email and gender and prints them and the second function that prompts the user to print the rate of paye(30%), nssf(11%), gross amount and calculates the netpay
